        <div class="span-13 content">
          <p>A scene represents a distinct game state, such as a menu or a level screen.</p>

<p>Entities are added to a particular scene using a grid-like configuration layout, which corresponds to a definition map.</p>

<p>The engine will take care of rendering the current scene, including updating and drawing its associated entities, although scene transitions must be specified manually - see ‘Scene transitions’ below.</p>

<h2 id="the-definition-map">The definition map</h2>
<p>The <strong>definition map</strong> is a set of rules mapping identifiers to objects for initializing scenes and entities.</p>

<p>In human terms, it allows you to define your game scenes/levels using an intuitive grid format,
and the engine will automatically construct and place entities for you.</p>

<p>The map is a key-value listing of <strong>rules</strong>, which are explained in the terminology section.</p>

<p>You must set <code>Kona.Scenes.definitionMap</code> to contain your configuration.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rule</strong>: an key-value pair specifying an identifier and the object it creates</li>
  <li><strong>Identifier</strong>: a string representing an object. Ex: <code>'-'</code> could represent a blank tile, and <code>'x'</code> an Enemy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="entity-constructor-arguments">Entity constructor arguments:</h3>

<p>The ‘value’ of a key-value rule is itself a key-value list of arguments.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>group</strong> (String) - The group this entity belongs to. See ‘Entity Groups’ below.</li>
  <li><strong>entity</strong> (Object) - The entity class to instantiate. Ex: <code>Kona.Tile</code> or <code>Enemy</code></li>
  <li><strong>opts</strong> (Object) - Optional arguments that will be passed to the entity constructor when it is called.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example map might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Kona.Scenes.definitionMap = {
  '-': { group: 'tiles',   entity: Kona.BlankTile }
  'r': { group: 'tiles',   entity: Kona.Tile, opts: { sprite: 'img/dirt.png' } }
  'x': { group: 'enemies', entity: Enemy,     opts: { width: 30, height: 55 } }
  'c': { group: 'coins',   entity: Coin,      opts: { width: 30, height: 30 } }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We will see how the map is put to use in the next section.</p>

<hr />
<p>## Constructing a scene and loading entities
A scene must be constructed before its entities can be loaded. In this example, we’ll construct and load entities for the first screen of the first level.
A string <strong>name</strong> is required for each scene. <strong>background</strong> specifies an optional background image path, and the <strong>active</strong> boolean is used to indicate the first scene to render after starting the engine. The active parameter can be omitted and does not have to be explicitly set to false - just make sure one of your scenes is active when you start the engine.</p>

<pre><code>level1_1 = new Kona.Scene {
  name: 'lvl1:s1'
  background: 'lvl1.jpg'
  active: true # Since it's marked as active, this scene will be the first to show
}
</code></pre>

<p>Entities are loaded using a call to <code>loadEntities(grid)</code>, where <code>scene</code> is some pre-constructed scene object.
  * <strong>grid</strong>: (Array) - A two dimensional array (‘grid’) of values to load into the scene.
    All values must correspond to rules in the definition map, explained previously.</p>

<p>An example grid might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>level1_1.loadEntities [
  ['-','-','-','-','-',],
  ['r','b','-','-','-',],
  ['o','-','-','-','-',],
  ['r','-','c','-','-',],
  ['b','o','r','b','r',]
]
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Entity instances can also be manually added to a scene using <code>addEntity()</code>. Ex: <code>Kona.Scenes.currentScene.addEntity(player)</code></p>

<p>This is useful is you want to keep a reference to the entity around for scripting. In the example above, we add the player to the scene and can then write code such as <code>Kona.Keys.bind 'space', -&gt; player.fire()</code></p>

<h2 id="entity-groups">Entity groups</h2>
<p>Each scene internally keeps track of a list of associated entities. These entities are divided into named <strong>groups</strong>. Example groups might consist of <code>tiles</code>, <code>enemies</code>, <code>collectables</code>, etc. All entities in all groups will be automatically updated and rendered by the engine, but this gives a useful handle to the developer for access or scripting. An entity is required to belong to a specific group - see the group field of the definition map.</p>

<p>Groups have many uses and make tasks much easier - for example, entities in the <code>player</code> group can be scripted to only be able to destroy entities in the <code>enemies</code> group. Additionally, groups are used internally to keep track of Collectors, which are entities that are allowed to ‘pick up’ collectables such as powerups.</p>

<h2 id="scene-transitions">Scene transitions</h2>
<p>Once you have constructed all of the scenes for your game and loaded their entities, you will need to make the calls to transition between them at the appropriate time.</p>

<h3 id="manually">Manually</h3>
<p>You can manually transition to any scene by calling <code>Kona.Scenes.setCurrent(sceneName)</code>. For example, you could bind the escape key to <code>Kona.Scenes.setCurrent('pauseMenu')</code>.</p>
