An entity is any renderable object which belongs to a scene. `Kona.Entity` implements an abstract backbone for your game objects. Basics such as position, direction, box model, and collision detection/resolution are handled within this class.

All distinct objects that render to the canvas should inherit from `Kona.Entity` - players, enemies, projectiles, collectables, etc.

Constructor example:

    class Enemy extends Kona.Entity
      constructor: (opts={}) ->
        super(opts)
        # custom code here ...



## Edge Accessors
Methods are provided to access the coordinates of the entities box edges, in pixels.
For example, `entity.top()` will return the y-coordinate of the top edge.

* `top()` - y-coordinate of the top edge
* `bottom()` - y-coordinate of the top edge
* `left()` - x-coordinate of the top edge
* `right()` - x-coordinate of the top edge

## Motion / Position
Various helpers for dealing with motion and position.

* `movingLeft()` - Boolean indicating whether or not the entity is currently moving left
* `movingRight()` - Boolean indicating whether or not the entity is currently moving right
* `addGravity()` - Boolean indicating whether or not the entity is currently moving left
* `setPosition(x, y)` - Move the entity to a specified pair of integer x,y coordinates
* `stop(axis)` - Stop all motion on an axis. Motion is stopped in all directions if one is not provided. Ex: `entity.stop('dx')`
* `onSurface()` - Boolean indicating whether or not the entity is standing on a solid surface

## Collision Detection
 For each edge (left, right, top, bottom), there are 2 methods for detecting collisions on that edge.

__Plural methods__, ex `leftCollisions()`, check for collisions with any other entities in the current scene in the scene.

__Singular__ methods, ex `leftCollision()`, check for collisions with a specified entity passed as a parameter

__Left Collisions__ (left edge hitting another entities right):
* `leftCollision(entity)` - Boolean indicating whether or not the left edge is colliding with the specified entity
* `leftCollisions()` - Boolean indicating whether or not there is a left collision with any neighboring entity

__Right Collision__ (right edge hitting another entities left):
* `rightCollision(entity)` - Boolean indicating whether or not the right edge is colliding with the specified entity
* `rightCollisions()` - Boolean indicating whether or not there is a right collision with any neighboring entity

__Top Collisions__ (top edge hitting another entities bottom):
* `topCollision(entity)` - Boolean indicating whether or not the top edge is colliding with the specified entity
* `topCollisions()` - Boolean indicating whether or not there is a top collision with any neighboring entity

__Bottom Collisions__ (bottom edge hitting another entities top):
* `bottomCollision(entity)` - Boolean indicating whether or not the bottom edge is colliding with the specified entity
* `bottomCollisions()` - Boolean indicating whether or not there is a bottom collision with any neighboring entity

## Collision Resolution
Resolve collisions after getting user input and applying transformations to entity

For example, prevent a player from falling through the floor after applying gravity.

* `correctLeft()` - move an entity away from a left collision
* `correctRight()` - move an entity away from a right collision
* `correctTop()` - move an entity away from a top collision
* `correctBottom()` - move an entity away from a bottom collision

## Collectables
The `collects()` method is used to mark an entity as a __collector__ for a __group__ of collectables. It is intended for initialization in a constructor.

After calling, this entity will automatically collect ('activate') the specified collectables on contact.

See docs for Kona.Collectable.

Example:

    class Player extends Kona.Entity
      constructor: (opts={}) ->
        super(opts)
        @collects('coins', 'weapons')
